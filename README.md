# CustomerPlus
This application is a WGU Java project that allows users to organize customers,
salespeople, and appointments between them. The database is network-based and is 
hoseted by a MySQL database and accessed through the MYSQLJDBC Driver. There is
multi-language functionality that is implemented via Lang resource bundles.

## User Interface
After a simple login page ("admin", "admin") the user is brought to a main screen
which brings together customers and appointments in two tables.

From there the user can easily navigate between customers (adding, modifying, 
deleting), appointments (adding, modifying, deleting), and contacts.
